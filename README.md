# Goldlight

Have you ever wanted to add UUIDs directly in an editor window, without having to generate them in an external tool? Goldlight Identity allows you to add a single UUID, or multiple UUIDs if you have multiple insertion points.

## Features
Click in the editor window and search for Generate UUID in the command palette, or use the Ctrl+U, Ctrl+U shortcut to directly add the entry.

If you have multiple or replacement points in the editor, the same process generates as many entries as you have selected. 

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 0.0.1
